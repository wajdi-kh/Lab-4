# Lab 4 – Data Quality Assessment & Preprocessing

# Overview
This lab focuses on practical data preprocessing techniques commonly used in real-world machine learning projects.
Before building any ML model, data must be cleaned, validated, and transformed properly.

In this lab, we applied step-by-step preprocessing techniques on a sales dataset.

# Objectives

Task 1 – Data Quality Assessment

-Checked data types
-Identified missing values
-Checked for duplicate records
-Performed basic data inspection

Task 2 – Handling Missing Values

-Introduced artificial missing values
-Applied Median Imputation
-Justification: Median is robust to outliers and skewed distributions

Task 3 – Outlier Detection

-Used the IQR (Interquartile Range) method
-Calculated Q1, Q3, and IQR
-Identified outliers
-Removed extreme values

Task 4 – Data Normalization

Applied two scaling techniques:

1- Min-Max Scaling
    Scales values between 0 and 1
2- Z-Score Standardization
    Centers data around mean (0) with standard deviation of 1

Task 5 – Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

-Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction
-Interpreted explained variance ratio
-Analyzed how much variance each component captures

# Conclusion

Proper data preprocessing significantly improves machine learning model performance.
This lab demonstrates essential preprocessing steps required before model training.
